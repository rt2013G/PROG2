/*
 * "Naive" Algorithm of String Matching to find the number of occurrences of a pattern in a text.
 *
 * Given a text of size N and pattern of size M, the algorithm iterates the entire string once
 * and compares all characters  with the first character of the pattern, if this happens to be true, then it compares
 * all subsequent M characters of the string with the characters of the pattern, if any of those comparisons fails,
 * the appropriate variable is set to false. At the end of the second iteration, if said variable still holds true,
 * then the pattern is found and the number of occurrences is increase by one.
 *
 * In the worst case, the algorithm performs N*M comparisons between characters, therefore the complexity is O(N*M)
 * If N >> M, O â‰ˆ O(N)
 *
 * The function takes as input a text and a pattern, and returns the number of occurrences of pattern in text.
