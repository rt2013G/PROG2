# PROG2
A repository which stores the code for my university course "PROG2", with the purpose of being both a compendium and reference for myself.
All the code written here consists of simple 1-file programs that seldom include anything more than the barebones implementation of basic data structures and algorithms in C and C++.
Every function assumes the input values to be appropriate, for simplicity and cleanliness I also avoided superflous handling of edge cases.
